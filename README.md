# infovis_firstproject

This repo contains the first project for Information Visualization, a course held at the "Roma Tre University" by Prof. Maurizio Patrignanii.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Project requires the last version of D3 like 5.15.1, which is used in its minified version

### Design Specification
Create a json file with multivariate data: there are 10 data-points and each data-point has five quantitative variables whose values are all positive. Draw this dataset by means of a "parallel coordinates" diagram (consult the slides on the visualization of multivariate data) in which the first variable is used for the first axis, the second variable is used for the second axis and so on. By clicking with the left mouse button on the area between two axes they exchange places Make sure that the transformations are continuous and not jumps.
